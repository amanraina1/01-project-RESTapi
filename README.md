REST API is build in this project.
Postman app is used for the testing the functioning of the code
Database is not connected yet and the hardcoded data is used for the testing the functioning of the project.
In this project, i have mock data which i have downloaded from mockkaro.com and implemented the REST API functioning in the code.
In this code, GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE APIs are tested.

After this, i have connected the database which is MongoDb and applied Model View Controller method to segregate the code and to make code look cleaner and modular.
